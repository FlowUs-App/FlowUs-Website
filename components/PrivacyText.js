      Log Data
      <br />
      I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an
      error in the app I collect <br />
      data and information (through third party products) on your phone called
      Log Data. This Log <br />
      Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”)
      address, device <br />
      name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when
      utilizing my Service, the <br />
      time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
      <br />
      <br />
      Cookies
      <br />
      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
      anonymous unique <br />
      identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you
      visit and are stored on <br />
      your device's internal memory.
      <br />
      This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may
      use third party code <br />
      and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their
      services. You have <br />
      the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie
      is being sent to <br />
      your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to
      use some portions <br />
      of this Service.
      <br />
      <br />
      Service Providers
      <br />
      I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following
      reasons:
      <br />
      To facilitate our Service;
      <br />
      To provide the Service on our behalf;
      <br />
      To perform Service-related services; or
      <br />
      To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
      <br />
      I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have
      access to your Personal <br />
      Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our
      behalf. However, they <br />
      are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other
      purpose.
      <br />
      <br />
      Security
      <br />
      I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are
      striving to use
      <br />
      commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no
      method of transmission <br />
      over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and
      reliable, and I cannot <br />
      guarantee its absolute security.
      <br />
      <br />
      Links to Other Sites
      <br />
      This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a
      third-party link, you will be directed <br />
      to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me.
      Therefore, I strongly <br />
      advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no
      control over and assume no <br />
      responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any
      third-party sites or <br />
      services.

      <br />
      Children’s Privacy
      <br />
      These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not
      knowingly collect personally <br />
      identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover
      that a child under 13 <br />
      has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from
      our servers. If you <br />
      are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
      with personal <br />
      information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary
      actions.

      Terms & Conditions
      <br />
      By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to
      you – you should make <br />
      sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re
      not allowed to copy, <br />
      or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
      You’re not allowed to <br />
      attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
      to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions.
      The app itself, and all the trade marks, <br />
      copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related
      to it, still belong to Lucas Goldner.
      <br />
      Lucas Goldner is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
      efficient as possible. For <br />
      that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge
      for its services, at <br />
      any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
      services without <br />
      making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      <br />
      The FlowUs app stores and processes personal data that you have provided
      to us, in order to <br />
      provide my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access
      to the app <br />
      secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your
      phone, which is the <br />
      process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
      official operating <br />
      system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
      malware/viruses/malicious <br />
      programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
      the FlowUs app <br />
      won’t work properly or at all.
      <br />
      The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and
      Conditions.

      You should be aware that there are certain things that Lucas Goldner will
      not take responsibility <br />
      for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active
      internet connection. <br />
      The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider,
      but Lucas <br />
      Goldner cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
      functionality if you don’t have <br />
      access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember
      that your terms of the <br />
      agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result,
      you may be charged <br />
      by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
      connection while <br />
      accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re
      accepting responsibility
      <br /> for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the
      app <br />
      outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
      off data roaming. If you are <br />
      not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be
      aware that we <br />
      assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the
      app.
      <br />
      <br />
      Along the same lines, Lucas Goldner cannot always take responsibility for
      the way you use the <br />
      app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs
      out of battery and <br />
      you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Lucas Goldner cannot accept
      responsibility.
      <br />
      With respect to Lucas Goldner’s responsibility for your use of the app,
      when you’re using the app, <br />
      it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that
      it is updated and <br />
      correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information
      to us so that we can <br />
      make it available to you. Lucas Goldner accepts no liability for any loss,
      direct or indirect, <br />
      you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the
      app.
      <br />
      At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
      available on iOS – the <br />
      requirements for system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend
      the availability of <br />
      the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you
      want to keep using <br />
      the app. Lucas Goldner does not promise that it will always update the app
      so that it is <br />
      relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed
      on your device. <br />
      However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when
      offered to you, We may <br />
      also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any
      time without giving <br />
      notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
      termination, (a) the <br />
      rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must
      stop using the app, and <br />
      (if needed) delete it from your device.
      <br />
      <br />
      Changes to This Terms and Conditions
      <br />
      I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are
      advised to review this <br />
      page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by
      posting the new Terms <br />
      and Conditions on this page.
      <br />
      These terms and conditions are effective as of 2021-01-21
